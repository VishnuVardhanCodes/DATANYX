**🏆 Hackathon Journey — DATANYX 2025**
**MedTech Edition — MJCET, Hyderabad**

Our team built this project during the DATANYX 2025 – 24-Hour MedTech Hackathon, hosted at Muffakham Jah College of Engineering & Technology (MJCET), Hyderabad. With a mission to contribute to data-driven healthcare innovation, we designed a complete AI-powered Immunodeficiency Gene Expression Analyzer capable of analyzing patient genomics, visualizing molecular patterns, and generating doctor-style diagnostic reports.

What began as a raw idea quickly evolved into a functional MedTech prototype — developed under extreme time constraints, continuous debugging, and a drive to create something clinically meaningful.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Immunological disorders often require analyzing high-dimensional gene expression data, which is complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Our solution aims to simplify this process by providing:

Automated ML-based immune dysfunction prediction

PCA-powered dimensionality reduction

Cluster-based patient similarity search

Gene variability analysis & high-resolution heatmaps

Doctor-style PDF medical report generation

LLM-supported medical interpretations

A fully interactive Streamlit dashboard for ease of use

This makes the tool useful for clinical researchers, geneticists, bioinformatics teams, and hackathon evaluators.

**🌟 Why This Project Was Unique at DATANYX 2025**

During the hackathon, most teams focused on broad data analytics.
We specifically targeted healthcare genomics, a challenging but impactful domain.

**What made our solution stand out:**

✔ Full ML + Data Science Pipeline

We implemented machine learning, PCA, clustering, variability analysis, and similarity search — all optimized for real biomedical datasets.

✔ LLM Integration for Real Clinical Insight

To enrich the medical interpretability of results, we integrated:

**Gemini API (Google AI)** for generating detailed clinical insights, gene dysregulation summaries, and final diagnosis narratives.

**TinyLLaMA models** for offline research summarization and cross-checking biological context.

This created a hybrid system capable of both computation and interpretation.

**✔ True End-to-End MedTech Workflow**

From raw CSV data → ML pipeline → visualization → interpretation → final medical PDF.
Every step was automated and built within the hackathon timeframe.

**✔ Clean, Intuitive Streamlit Interface**

Even under a 24-hour sprint, the UI was made polished and evaluator-friendly with:

Real-time plots

Progress messages

Parameter summaries

Heatmap views

Download buttons
